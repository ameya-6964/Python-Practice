# Multi-line statement
# In Python, the end of a statement is marked by a newline character. But we can make a statement extend over
# multiple lines with the line continuation character (\). For example:
a = 1 + 2 + 3 + \
4 + 5 + 6 + \
7 + 8 + 9

print(a)

#OUTPUT : - 45

# Can Also Be Written As Using () instead Of / 

b = (1 + 2 + 3 +
4 + 5 + 6 +
7 + 8 + 9)

print(b)

#OUTPUT : - 45

# Can Also Be Written As Using [] 
colors = ['red','blue','green']

print(colors)

# OUTPUT : -  ['red', 'blue', 'green']
